          <h3>School Hub Project</h3>

<p>SchoolHub project is an attempt to create a unified school system on the cloud. SchoolHub consists of an <em>information system</em>, <em>school management system</em> and a <em>learning management system</em>.</p>

<h3>Background</h3>
<p>SchoolHub is being developed by AceEdventure Pixel Sdn Bhd. This is a fairly young company, working together with a fast growing education group to improve system infrastructure for education institutions.
  Using the various schools and tuition centers under this group as case studies, the team is trying to improve education workflow from inside the school itself by working together with the people that actually runs the education centers.</p>
<p>The learning management system is being developed by an established company in Singapore, which itself has been developing education related systems for Singapore's education institution for over 10 years. By collaborating with this company,
SchoolHub is producing a solid lineup of tools for managing the <strong>school</strong> and learning in the <strong>classroom</strong>.</p>
<p>The company has applied for, and is expected to get <a href="http://www.mscmalaysia.my/isv">MSC status</a> in Malaysia by the second half of the year 2013.</p>
<p>We share our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.344077632349957.79532.343076899116697&type=3">studio</a> with <a href="https://www.facebook.com/aceedventure.studio">these</a> guys.</p>
